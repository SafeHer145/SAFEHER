Place your launcher icon here as a 1024x1024 PNG named app_icon.png.

Path: assets/icon/app_icon.png
Notes:
- Prefer transparent background for better adaptive icon results.
- You can also provide a separate foreground (fg.png) and set adaptive_icon_foreground in pubspec.yaml.
- After adding the image, run:
  flutter pub get
  dart run flutter_launcher_icons
